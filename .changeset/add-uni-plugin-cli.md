"uni-plugin": minor

Add initial `uni-plugin` CLI with cross-vendor plugin management commands.

New commands:

- `prepare` — diffs the current vendor's installed plugins against the last snapshot and writes pending cross-vendor sync actions to state.
- `sync apply <actionId>` — executes a pending install, update, or remove action using the target vendor's registered CLI command (or emits a manual instruction when none is configured).
- `governance show <name>` / `governance list` — resolves and displays governance files by scope (global → project).
- `asset-store` — manages the local store of downloaded plugin assets.
- `self-update` — rewrites `uni-plugin` version pins in hook files when a newer version is detected.
- `clean` — removes the local asset store directory.

Supporting modules added: state file schema with tolerant reader and mutation helpers, vendor registry with bundled defaults and user-override support, source registry with store-path derivation for npm / GitHub / GitLab / URL sources.
