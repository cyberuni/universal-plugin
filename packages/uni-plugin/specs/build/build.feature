Feature: build plugin manifests

  Background:
    Given a project root with ".plugin/plugin.json"

  Scenario: builds all declared vendors
    Given the manifest declares vendorExtensions for "claude-code" and "cursor"
    When I run "uni-plugin build"
    Then ".claude-plugin/plugin.json" is written
    And ".cursor-plugin/plugin.json" is written
    And the exit code is 0

  Scenario: vendor-specific fields are merged into output
    Given the manifest has name "my-plugin" and skills "./skills/"
    And vendorExtensions.claude-code has displayName "My Plugin"
    When I run "uni-plugin build"
    Then ".claude-plugin/plugin.json" contains name "my-plugin"
    And ".claude-plugin/plugin.json" contains skills "./skills/"
    And ".claude-plugin/plugin.json" contains displayName "My Plugin"

  Scenario: vendorExtensions and $schema are stripped from output
    Given the manifest has a $schema field and vendorExtensions
    When I run "uni-plugin build"
    Then the output file does not contain "vendorExtensions"
    And the output file does not contain "$schema"

  Scenario: --vendor filters to a single vendor
    Given the manifest declares vendorExtensions for "claude-code" and "cursor"
    When I run "uni-plugin build --vendor claude-code"
    Then ".claude-plugin/plugin.json" is written
    And ".cursor-plugin/plugin.json" is NOT written
    And the exit code is 0

  Scenario: --vendor not in vendorExtensions fails
    Given the manifest declares vendorExtensions for "claude-code" only
    When I run "uni-plugin build --vendor cursor"
    Then the exit code is 1
    And stderr contains "not declared in vendorExtensions"

  Scenario: no vendorExtensions declared produces warning
    Given the manifest has no vendorExtensions field
    When I run "uni-plugin build"
    Then the exit code is 0
    And no output files are written
    And stdout or stderr contains "nothing to build"

  Scenario: unknown vendor in vendorExtensions is warned and skipped
    Given vendorExtensions contains an unknown vendor key "acme"
    When I run "uni-plugin build"
    Then the exit code is 0
    And stdout or stderr contains "Unknown vendor"
    And no output file is written for "acme"

  Scenario: missing .plugin/plugin.json fails
    Given the project root has no ".plugin/plugin.json"
    When I run "uni-plugin build"
    Then the exit code is 1
    And stderr contains "No .plugin/plugin.json found"

  Scenario: codex vendor requires description and version
    Given the manifest declares vendorExtensions for "codex"
    And the manifest has no description or version
    When I run "uni-plugin build"
    Then the exit code is 1
    And stderr contains "description is required when targeting codex"
    And stderr contains "version is required when targeting codex"

  Scenario: --dry-run skips file writes
    Given the manifest declares vendorExtensions for "claude-code"
    When I run "uni-plugin build --dry-run"
    Then the exit code is 0
    And ".claude-plugin/plugin.json" is NOT written

  Scenario: --clean removes existing output before writing
    Given ".claude-plugin/plugin.json" already exists from a previous build
    When I run "uni-plugin build --clean"
    Then ".claude-plugin/plugin.json" is removed and rewritten
    And the exit code is 0
