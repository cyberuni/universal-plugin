**universal-plugin** is a build tool for universal AI agent plugins. You write one canonical definition in root `plugin.json`, and `universal-plugin plugin build` generates a spec-conformant vendor manifest for each runtime you target.

## The problem

Every major AI coding agent runtime — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, GitHub Copilot CLI — uses its own `plugin.json` format at a vendor-specific path. Targeting multiple runtimes means maintaining multiple manifest files that share ~60% of their content, hand-writing vendor-specific transformations (hook event casing, env var names, component fields), and re-syncing on every change.

## The solution

A single source of truth in root `plugin.json`, following the closed [Agent Plugins Specification v1.0.0](https://agent-plugins.org) field set (`$schema`, `name`, `version`, `description`, `author`, `homepage`, `repository`, `license`, `keywords`, `extensions`). All `universal-plugin` build config — component paths, the vendor target list, and per-harness overrides — nests under `extensions["org.cyberuni.universal-plugin"]`. Running `universal-plugin plugin build` produces each vendor's manifest as a build artifact.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json",
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "extensions": {
    "org.cyberuni.universal-plugin": {
      "vendors": ["claude-code", "cursor", "codex", "copilot-cli"],
      "skills": "./skills/",
      "mcpServers": "./mcp.json",
      "hooks": "./hooks/hooks.json",
      "harnesses": {
        "claude-code": { "monitors": "./monitors/monitors.json" },
        "cursor": { "publisher": "my-org", "logo": "./assets/logo.png" },
        "codex": { "version": "1.0.0", "description": "My plugin." },
        "copilot-cli": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Running `universal-plugin plugin build` from the plugin root generates:

| Vendor | Output |
|---|---|
| `claude-code` | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` |
| `cursor` | `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` |
| `codex` | `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` |
| `copilot-cli` | `plugin.json` |

## What gets transformed

- **Hook event names** — canonical PascalCase (`SessionStart`) is translated to each vendor's casing (camelCase for Cursor, PascalCase for Claude Code and Codex).
- **Env vars** — canonical `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` is translated to vendor-native names in hook commands and MCP configs.
- **Vendor-specific fields** — fields in `extensions["org.cyberuni.universal-plugin"].harnesses.<vendor>` are merged into the generated manifest; fields the vendor doesn't support are dropped with a warning.
- **Required field enforcement** — Codex requires `version` and `description`; build fails with a clear error if they're missing.

## Generated files are build artifacts

The generated vendor manifests should be treated like compiled output — either gitignored (build on install) or committed (pre-built for distribution). The choice is yours; `universal-plugin` enforces neither.

## Configuring a repository, not publishing a plugin

`universal-plugin` builds a plugin you publish. It does not set up the agent configuration of the repository you work in.

For that, use [`buddy-agent-harness`](https://github.com/repobuddy/buddy-agent-harness). It initializes a repository's canonical `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/` tree, then links it to each harness that needs its own path. Read its documentation to learn how the harnesses differ and what a universal agent configuration looks like.
